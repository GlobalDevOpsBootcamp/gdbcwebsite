<p class="lead">The first ever Global DevOps Bootcamp took place on June 17th, 2017. The goal with the event was to create an event-in-a-box that was to be delivered the same day throughout the world where attendees would get a chance to learn and try out the latest DevOps principles using the Microsoft platform. To make this happen the organizers were provided with presentations and hands-on labs. Since the topic is rather large and people were expected to have different skills coming to the event virtual machines were prepared so all the attendees needed was a computer that could connect to a virtual machine. All exercises were then run on the Azure VM.</p>

<p>The theme for 2017 was “From Server to Serverless in a DevOps world” with the goal set to understand how VSTS and Azure can give you a great toolchain and a hosting platform to build and operate a software solution. Through a set of challenges, the attendees took a classical n-tier application and released it to services in Azure (including Docker containers). The progress of each team could be tracked on a leaderboard web which gave the event a competitive edge. And it was also fun to watch how the event progressed from east to west throughout the day.</p>

<p>In total 30 venues from all around the world participated in the bootcamps and 1500 persons attended.</p>

<p>Last, but not the least, some quotes from the attendees:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Everyone had a good time, arrived enthusiastic and left enthusiastic, and we had fun too! Would definitely be up for getting involved next year!”</li>
  <li>“It was great as we learned so many new things in just a day”</li>
  <li>“We are Linux oriented software developers and Azure, C# and VSTS we have never seen before. Still we found how easy all this was”</li>
  <li>“What a relief you don’t have to setup your own machine”</li>
  <li>“I wish all events were more like this instead of the regular meetup formats”</li>
  <li>“This was one of the best Saturdays I’ve had”</li>
</ul>
