## Introduction
 
We are on! We are in the preparation for Global DevOps Bootcamp 2022. Unfortunately we had to cancel the event in 2020 and did not even bother in 2021, but now we are buzzing again. Time for a new edition of Global DevOps Bootcamp. In this post, we will inform you about the event, the plans and ask you to  consider hosting the event this year. Different from previous years, we are building a hybrid event, which means, on location, virtual and (if people want to) mixed. 
 
Global DevOps Bootcamp will be held on Saturday May 14th.

## What is Global DevOps Bootcamp
Maybe you are already familiar with the Global DevOps Bootcamp. If not, read on! Global DevOps Bootcamp (or GDBC) is a worldwide event that is hosted and organized by many different companies and people all around the world. 
 
Global DevOps Bootcamp (GDBC) is a worldwide community event that will be held for the 4th time. Every year, we create a full-day experience around a central theme. The day starts with a keynote (of a famous speaker!) a local keynote (by a local venue!), and a challenging yet inspiring hackathon focusing on DevOps practices and Modern Software practices. People also learn about the latest trends and will be sharing their DevOps experiences. 
 
The goals of the Global DevOps Bootcamp are:
 
 - Create more awareness around DevOps in general
 - Insights into where we are heading when it comes to DevOps and new technologies
 - Get people's hands dirty and let them play with all the good Microsoft stuff
 
The theme of this year will be `Embrace Chaos to Achieve Stability`. We will dive into concepts of Chaos Engineering

To make things easier to join, and to align the content, The core GDBC team (community people from Xpirit and Solidify) will take care of most things. We provide you with a recorded keynote, a prepared local presentation for you to redeliver, A fully working infrastructure on Azure and Github so attendees do not have to spend time shaving yaks, real world challenges and a true interactive experience.

## What we ask from you
The first and most obvious question: Would you like to organize this event for your community? Basically you have to arrange a venue and some lunch (usually we get sponsorships here üòä ) and some local sponsors/prizes and of course supporting proctors and time to prepare well!. Then of course someone needs to deliver the content we provide, preferably YOU üòä
 
We have yet to fill in a lot of details and try to get Global coverage. We ask you because we know you are as fanatic as us, but feel free to point others to us as well, so we can we onboard them in our process as well!
 
We look forward to hearing from you and make this a great success!
