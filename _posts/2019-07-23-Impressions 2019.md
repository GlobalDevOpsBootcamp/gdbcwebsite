Global DevOps Bootcamp is a free one-day event hosted by local passionate DevOps communities around the globe, centrally organized by Xpirit & Solidify and sponsored by Microsoft. The global DevOps Bootcamp was organized the first time in 2017, where everyone was overwhelmed by the success of the event.

In 2019 the global DevOps Bootcamp was again organized by the same team, with some additional help from community members.

GDBC follows the concept of an event out of the box, where we can guarantee the quality of the learning experience with global exposure. Providing an experience where everyone can focus on DevOps and getting all potential issues out of the way of participants is of crucial importance to us. This year‚Äôs theme was: You build it, you run away it, following the steps 'detect, respond, recover' where we focused on the run part of DevOps.

Niall Murphy, Director of Engineering for Azure Cloud Services and Site Reliability Engineering for Microsoft, helped out by recording a video on what Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is and how its practices work in conjunction with DevOps.

The local Keynote was mostly delivered by the organizers of the venues. We also had some special guests appearing around the globe; The League of DevOps Advocates run by Donovan Brown!

We provided all the attendees with 8 disruptions they could complete where they had to work together as a team to first detect the disruption on the web shop we provisioned for them. Next they could respond with a quick fix to get their shop up and running again. Then they had time to figure out a permanent solution to automatically recover or prevent the disruption from happening in the first place.

A list of all the disruptions you could challenge your team with:

1. Message from the CEO - Help needed on Social Media
1. Sentiment on social media (Twitter) goes negative due to issue with site
1. Credentials are leaked and are rotated
1. SSL Certificate suddenly expired
1. Connections to database are flaky and causes random errors
1. Denial of service on your application
1. Supply chain attack
1. Exception rate goes up


In total 89 venues from all around the world participated in the bootcamps and 10.000 people attended.

Finally, some comments from the attendees:

- Attendee: ‚ÄúThe Azure DevOps tools were not familiar to me until now, but this was really awesome‚Äù
- Product Owner Maersk: ‚Äú..for example I recommended to my architect that he join the bootcamp as part of his 'discovery growth' for this year.He came back from that event literally 'glowing' from the experience of spending half of his weekend working on a DevOps scenario..‚Äù
- Attendee: ‚ÄúI never worked with Azure, but I did not know it was so easy!‚Äù
- Product Marketing Manager Azure DevOps: ‚ÄúLet me join the others in congratulating you for the success!"

- "I hope we'll be able to partner again next year!‚Äù
- Attendee:  ‚ÄúGreat to learn the run side of DevOps, now I know it is called SRE üòä‚Äù
