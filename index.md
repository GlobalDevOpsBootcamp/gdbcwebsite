<h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-white">What is Global DevOps Bootcamp</h1>

<p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Global DevOps Bootcamp is a worldwide community event that has now been
    organized for three years in a row. Each year, we create a full-day experience around a central theme.
    The day starts with a keynote (of a famous speaker!), a local keynote (by you!), and a challenging yet
    inspiring hackathon focusing on DevOps practices and Modern Software practices. People also learn about
    the latest trends and will be sharing their DevOps experiences. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to learn
    hands-on and network with others locally working in this space, and also get to hear all about some
    real-world DevOps experiences.</p>

<p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
    The event is held globally on the same day. The great thing for you as an organizer, is that you only
    have to worry about a good location and skilled people that can proctor during the day. We will take
    care of the rest. We will provide you all materials for the keynote and hackathon, provide you with
    marketing materials and during the day we provide a fully-fledged infrastructure so that your
    participants can get started right away! The last edition, we had around 90 venues and 10.000 people
    joining worldwide.</p>
