<title>Global DevOps Bootcamp | Global DevOps Bootcamp is a worldwide community event that has now been organized for three years in a row. Each year, we create a full-day experience around a central theme. The day starts with a keynote (of a famous speaker!), a local keynote (by you!), and a challenging yet inspiring hackathon focusing on DevOps practices and Modern Software practices. People also learn about the latest trends and will be sharing their DevOps experiences. It’s a great opportunity to learn hands-on and network with others locally working in this space, and also get to hear all about some real-world DevOps experiences.</title>

          <p class="leading-relaxed">After our cancellation of GDBC 2020 due to the pandemic we found new energy and motivation to start a GDBC 2022 edition. In September we, Xpirit and Solidify, came together to draft the outline of a new type of event. Suitable for physical, online and hybrid location. We had bold plans and came up with the theme “Embrace Chaos to Achieve Stability”. In the last months we have been preparing GDBC 2022 with quite a large group of enthusiastic people.

          <p class="leading-relaxed">The first ever Global DevOps Bootcamp took place on June 17th, 2017. The goal with the event was to create an event-in-a-box that was to be delivered the same day throughout the world where attendees would get a chance to learn and try out the latest DevOps principles using the Microsoft platform. To make this happen the organizers were provided with presentations and hands-on labs. Since the topic is rather large and people were expected to have different skills coming to the event virtual machines were prepared so all the attendees needed was a computer that could connect to a virtual machine. All exercises were then run on the Azure VM.
