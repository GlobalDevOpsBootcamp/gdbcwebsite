<title>Global DevOps Bootcamp | Global DevOps Bootcamp is a worldwide community event that has now been organized for three years in a row. Each year, we create a full-day experience around a central theme. The day starts with a keynote (of a famous speaker!), a local keynote (by you!), and a challenging yet inspiring hackathon focusing on DevOps practices and Modern Software practices. People also learn about the latest trends and will be sharing their DevOps experiences. It’s a great opportunity to learn hands-on and network with others locally working in this space, and also get to hear all about some real-world DevOps experiences.</title>

<h2 id="local-sponsors">Local sponsors</h2>

<p>Try to find local sponsors that can provide prizes that can be won when teams win the competition. Some swag is provided by us, but experience learns people love to get local swag and this is also a terrific opportunity for you to raise your brand awareness.</p>
