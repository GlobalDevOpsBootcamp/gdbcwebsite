title: Global DevOps Bootcamp
description: |
   Global DevOps Bootcamp is a worldwide community event that has now been organized for three years in a row. Each year, we create a full-day experience around a central theme.
   The day starts with a keynote (of a famous speaker!), a local keynote (by you!), and a challenging yet inspiring hackathon focusing on DevOps practices and Modern Software practices.
   People also learn about the latest trends and will be sharing their DevOps experiences. Itâ€™s a great opportunity to learn hands-on and network with others locally working in this space,
   and also get to hear all about some real-world DevOps experiences.
